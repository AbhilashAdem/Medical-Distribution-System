            <p>
                Wholesale distribution of healthcare products is at the heart of Cardinal Health—it’s the foundation of our business.
                 We take great pride in having a global presence in healthcare distribution. We achieve this by putting our customers’ needs first.
                 Our logistics management processes help customers lower costs and reduce complexity while increasing visibility in their own supply chains.
                 And our people work tirelessly to ensure our delivery process is accurate, on time and responsive to specific requirements.
            </p>

                We know the medical supply distribution business inside and out. It’s the result of decades of industry leadership and innovation. 
                Our infrastructure is large and well-supported by dozens of warehouses, delivery trucks and supplier relationships.
                 But even more impressive are the people behind the deliveries.
